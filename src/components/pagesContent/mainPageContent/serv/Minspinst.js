              Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is a crucial consideration
              for long-term cost savings and environmental sustainability.
              Specialist prioritize recommending AC/HP mini split systems with
              high Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER2) ratings for cooling
              efficiency and high Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF2)
              ratings for heating efficiency. Higher SEER and HSPF ratings
              indicate better energy efficiency, resulting in reduced energy
              consumption and lower utility bills over time.
